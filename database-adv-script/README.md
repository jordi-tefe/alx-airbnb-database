# Complex SQL Joins - Airbnb Clone

This file contains complex SQL queries involving INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN operations for the simulated Airbnb database.

## Files Included
- `joins_queries.sql`: Contains the required JOIN queries

## Queries Explained
1. **INNER JOIN**: Lists all bookings along with the users who made them.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Lists all properties with their reviews, including those without reviews.
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Combines users and bookings to show even unmatched records using UNION (since MySQL lacks FULL OUTER JOIN support).

## Usage
Run these queries in your MySQL client connected to the Airbnb database.
